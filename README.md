#### Introduction

This repository contains codes for the algorithms described in the study [City Scale Image Geolocalization via Dense Scene Alignment](http://www.semihyagcioglu.com/projects/image-geolocalization).

Please refer to project page for more details, which is avaliable at http://www.semihyagcioglu.com/projects/image-geolocalization

#### Requirements

- Matlab
- VLFeat library (vlfeat.org)

#### Installation

- For DSP (Deformable Spatial Pyramid Matching for Fast Dense Correspondences) code, you need to download the code from http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/dsp/ and follow the installation instuctions.
- You can download San Francisco Landmark dataset from http://purl.stanford.edu/vn158kj2087

#### Notes

- lib folder holds external libraries used in the project
- data folder holds data files used in the project
- You may want change the default values in the LoadPreRequisities.m
- You can change algorithm parameters via settings.ini
- As a pre-processing step, you should extract image features via CreateAllImageFeaturesAtOnce.m
- We used a slightly modified version of gist code provided here http://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/code/spatialenvelope/

#### Demo

	DemoApp('test', ~); % This will run demo app in test mode with the default settings.
